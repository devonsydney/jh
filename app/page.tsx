              <div>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  I am a Registered Therapeutic Counsellor and graduate of the Orca Institute in British Columbia, Canada. Currently dividing my time between London, UK and Vancouver, BC.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  With a foundation in diverse therapeutic techniques, I am dedicated to establishing safe, supportive environments for my clients. My intention is to empower others through compassionate communication, tailored treatment planning, and growth-oriented interventions. I embrace a collaborative approach, fostering individual autonomy and promoting self-efficacy.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold uppercase mb-4 text-gray-200">Therapeutic Approach</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                I have a warm, client-centered therapeutic technique. In my sessions, I focus on the body-mind connection, self-compassion, mindfulness, pattern identification, and providing you with goal-directed tools and resources. First and foremost, I believe the relationship between client and counselor is critical. Beginning from a strong foundation of trust sets the most successful path forwards.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold uppercase mb-4 text-gray-200">Counselling Philosophy</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                I embrace a philosophy of dynamic human experience, with respect for the nuance of individualism. I believe that we have the power to transform our lives and outlook using our own pain and self awareness as mechanisms for change. I see suffering as an opportunity to grow and believe that our potential to do so is only limited by our thoughts and habits - all of which are malleable.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Fulfillment can be found by engaging in healthy relationships, meaningful work, achieving a sense of belonging and through a practice of resilience. I see the meeting of these as an antidote to feeling lost, lonely, depressed and anxious. However, I do understand that while these symptoms are present, it can be difficult to navigate a path forward, which is why I am here to help.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The world can be a heavy place and our bodies are often overwhelmed with thoughts and feelings that have no place to go. I offer you a safe space to be seen and heard, where you can freely express yourself without fear of judgment. We will work together to identify possibilities of change and find the tools that work best for you.
